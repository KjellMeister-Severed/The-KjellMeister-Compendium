            <p>
                Your patron is an exceptionally powerful storm giant, who in
                an attempt to extend their existance beyond their natural
                lifespan has melded their essence wih the forces of the
                natural world, becoming one with the elements and
                commanding them as an extension of their being, a power
                that has now been bestowed onto you. Their ascencion
                although granting them great power over the forces of nature,
                has also confined them to the form of a perpetual storm
                allowing them to coalesce for only brief moments at a time,
                so quintessents who grant a portion of their power to mortals
                generally seek to gain further influence upon the material
                world they are now detached from.

                At 1st level you learn how to speak, read, and write Giant and
                Primordial. Additionally you learn the gust cantrip. It counts
                as a warlock cantrip for you, but it doesn't count against the
                number of warlock cantrips you know, and you can cast it as
                a bonus action. When you cast it, you can push an object of
                up to 10 pounds away or towards you.

            At 1st level your patron has bestowed upon you control over a
            fraction of storm energy in the form of a lightning sword. You
            can summon it as a bonus action and you can dispell it at will,
            it is consider a simple melee weapon with which you are
            proficient, it deals 1d8 lightning or thunder damage (your
            choice), it has the versatile (1d10) property, and the thrown
            (80/320) property. When you attack with it you can use your
            Charisma modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for the
            attack and damage rolls. If you later take the Pact of the
            Blade feature you can use your lightning sword as your pact
            weapon.

            At 14th level you can call forth the full force of the elements in the form of a mighty storm. As an action you can summon a storm of 30 feet centered around you for 10 minutes, or until you dismiss it as a bonus action. The area of the storm moves with you. While the storm lasts, you gain a flight speed equal to your walking speed as long as you are sorrounded by strong winds. Every hostile creature that enters, or starts it's turn within the storm's range must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure they take 3d10 lightning damage, or half as much on a success. Once you use this feature you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
